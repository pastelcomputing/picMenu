## TODOs now

- [ ] Add some two good examples (one simple menu, one more complex)
- [ ] Add OG image

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Generate additional details (ingredients, origin, calories, taste) then display them in a modal when a user clicks a menu item
- [ ] After upload, do a nice scroll to the loading state when it's loading
- [ ] Add some tags as well (like spicy, vegetarian, vegan, etc.) to make the UI better
- [ ] Add filters for those tags to be able to filter by them for food restrictions
